                    can do a good job for your company. Just tell us what open position you have, hold interviews, sign
                    the contract and start the next day.</p>

                <p>Usually, the payment date is after 1 week work starting. The first invoice you receive is for all
                    remaining workdays in the month. After that, on the 1st of each month, you will receive an invoice
                    for 1 month in advance, with adjustments for actual hours worked in the previous month. The due date
                    is the 20th of the current month. As you can appreciate, it is very important to pay all contractors
                    on time.</p>
                <p class="block-subtitle">Ways of making the payment.</p>
                <p>You may pay through the wire transfer, PayPal, WebMoney, or Payoneer. Please pay attention to the
                    commission of different sources. In this case, a bank transfer will be more preferable as there are
                    no fees. We take an additional 10% if you pay through PayPal</p>
